# Graph algorithms

This repository contains my group project for the Functional Programming Course, using Scala, during my studies at CY Tech Engineering Graduate School in France.

The main tasks were :

- To implement certain classic algorithms on simple/strict graphs :

  - Welsh‑Powell
  - DSATUR
  - Dijkstra
  - Topological sorting

- To use these algorithms on some applications : 

  - Mini‑GPS
  - Antenna frequency assignment
  - Antenna reconnection
  - Imitation of a Makefile.
 
🚩 : Some of my projects intentionally remain without updates to serve as a record of my ongoing development and learning journey. 😁
